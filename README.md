# ELEE1147: Programming for  Engineers â€“ Coursework 2

This repository contains the completed version of the legacy codebase provided for ELEE1147 Assessment 2. I have identfied and fixed errors in the C and Python files, refactored the code following developer standards, and documented the process using Git and best practices.

## Project Overview

The original codebase included:
- A C program that simulates system activity and generates a log file
- A Python suite that analyzes the log and visualizes hardware usage over time

The goal was to identify and fix compile-time, runtime, and logical errors, then refactor and improve the code step by step.

## How to Run the C Simulation

1. Navigate to the `C/` directory.
2. Compile the code using:
   ```bash
   gcc main.c kernel.c -o sim
3. Run using:
    ./sim
4. A log file will be created in the logs/ folder.

## How to Run the Python Analysis

1. Make sure Python 3 is installed.
2. Install required packages:
    pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
3. Navigate to the Python/ folder and run:
    python main.py
4. Results will be saved in the results/ folder.
